      <h1>Welcome to Filmology!</h1>
      <p>
        Filmology is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing support and resources for individuals struggling
        with mental health issues. Our mission is to create a safe and inclusive space where people can find the help
        they need to improve their mental well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer a variety of services, including counseling, support groups, and educational workshops. Our team of
        trained professionals is committed to helping individuals navigate their mental health challenges and find
        effective coping strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Filmology, we believe that mental health is just as important as physical health, and we strive to break the
        stigma surrounding mental illness. We are here to provide a supportive community where individuals can share
        their experiences and find comfort in knowing they are not alone.
